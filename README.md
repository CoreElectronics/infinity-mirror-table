# Infinity-Mirror Table

This repository is where we're maintaining code for our Infinity-Mirror Table Project.
You can see the full build-process on our [project page](https://core-electronics.com.au/projects/infinity-mirror-table).

# WiFi connection
This code runs in SEMI_AUTOMATIC mode. This means that a WiFi connection is optional. Connect to the saved WiFi network by pressing the SETUP button. The running display will halt while a connection is established. 
If something goes wrong, enter safe mode as documented in the [particle refs](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#safe-mode).
